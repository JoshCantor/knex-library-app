I built a CRUD app using Express, PostreSQL and the Knex query builder. Resources include authors, books and book categories. 

The main challenge was creating a normalize data model and using RESTful routing.

Launch the app by cloning the repo, running ```node library.js``` and navigating to localhost:3000.
